    "`Metal speciation` (the distribution of a metal in different physical and chemical forms) is a key property in homogeneous catalysis. This feature plays a crucial role in determining catalyst properties like reactivity or selectivity. Ligands are one of the factors related to metal speciation. Despite the common assumption that structure and reactvity are correlated, the impact of the ligand on catalytic activity is not fully understood, hampering the design of new catalysts.\n",

    "Palladium-catalyzed reactions are one of the most representative transformations involving homogeneous catalysts. Despite the majority of catalytic cycles involve Pd(0) and Pd(II) species, Pd(I) dimers with the [Pd(I)(&mu;-X)P(t-Bu)<sub>3</sub>]<sub>2</sub> motif are specially interesting due to their stability and catalytic performance. However, it is not fully understood why certain ligands favor Pd(I) dimers while others do not, so only few examples of this type of compounds were known.\n",

Different attempts to overcome these limitations were tried. PCA decomposition using 28 general descriptors from a set of 348 monodentate phospine ligands was not able to derive ligand-speciation relationships. On the other hand, DFT calculation of the coprorportionation energy of Pd(0) with Pd(II) to Pd(I) suggested that high exergonicity was related to Pd(I) formation. However, the associated energy of PdCy<sub>3</sub> (non-inducing Pd(I) ligand) was rougly the same than the known Pd(I)-inducing phosphines, thus invalidating this hypothesis. \n",
